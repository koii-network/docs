Before deploying on Koii mainnet, it's important to test your workflow. This can be done on the testnet clusters. We recommend starting on testnet for a realistic cluster configuration, then finally launching on the mainnet.

<!-- TODO: Update when mainnet launched -->
When mainnet is launched,  testnet will support a faucet, you can obtain some testnet KOII for development and testing by running:

```sh
koii airdrop <AMOUNT>
```
