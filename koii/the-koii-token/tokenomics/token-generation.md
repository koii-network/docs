The Koii tokenomics universe is anchored by a **initial total supply of 10 billion KOII tokens**, ensuring scarcity and long-term value stability. **Inflation** begins at an **initial rate of 5%**, gradually **tapering by 15%** annually until it stabilizes at a **terminal rate of 1.5%**. This controlled inflation mechanism supports early network growth while ensuring stability as the network matures.

The token supply is divided into circulating and non-circulating portions. The circulating supply represents the tokens actively used within the ecosystem, while the non-circulating supply encompasses reserves allocated for network incentives, development, and foundational operations.

In addition to the standard inflationary measures, Koii introduces a unique account rent mechanism. Every account that stores data on the chain must either pay rent or hold enough KOII tokens to achieve rent-exempt status, ensuring efficient utilization of storage resources and encouraging active ecosystem participation.

Further enhancing the tokenomics, Koii implements a mechanism where 50% of gas fees are burned. This policy not only mitigates the effect of inflation as transaction volume increases but also introduces a deflationary aspect to the economy over time, promoting long-term sustainability and health of the network.
