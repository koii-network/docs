Returns identity and transaction information about a confirmed block in the ledger

### Parameters
u64 **required**
slot number, as `u64` integer

object **optional**
Configuration object containing the following fields:
  - [commitment](/develop/rpcapi/intro#configuring-state-commitment) `string` **optional**
      - Default: `finalized`
        - `processed` is not supported.
  - encoding `string` **optional**
      - Default: `json`
        encoding format for each returned transaction
      - `json``jsonParsed``base58``base64`

          *   `jsonParsed` attempts to use program-specific instruction parsers to return more human-readable and explicit data in the `transaction.message.instructions` list.
          *   If `jsonParsed` is requested but a parser cannot be found, the instruction falls back to regular JSON encoding (`accounts`, `data`, and `programIdIndex` fields).
  - transactionDetails `string` **optional**
    Default: `full`
    level of transaction detail to return
    Values:Â `full` `accounts` `signatures` `none`

      *   If `accounts` are requested, transaction details only include signatures and an annotated list of accounts in each transaction.
      *   Transaction metadata is limited to only: fee, err, pre\_balances, post\_balances, pre\_token\_balances, and post\_token\_balances.
  - maxSupportedTransactionVersion `number` **optional**
    the max transaction version to return in responses.
      *   If the requested block contains a transaction with a higher version, an error will be returned.
      *   If this parameter is omitted, only legacy transactions will be returned, and a block containing any versioned transaction will prompt the error.
  - rewards `bool` **optional**
      whether to populate the `rewards` array. If parameter not provided, the default includes rewards.

### Result

The result field will be an object with the following fields:

*   `<null>` - if specified block is not confirmed
*   `<object>` - if block is confirmed, an object with the following fields:
    *   `blockhash: <string>` - the blockhash of this block, as base-58 encoded string
    *   `previousBlockhash: <string>` - the blockhash of this block's parent, as base-58 encoded string; if the parent block is not available due to ledger cleanup, this field will return "11111111111111111111111111111111"
    *   `parentSlot: <u64>` - the slot index of this block's parent

            *   `preBalances: <array>` - array of u64 account balances from before the transaction was processed

            *   `innerInstructions: <array|null>` - List of [inner instructions](/develop/rpcapi/json-structures#inner-instructions) or `null` if inner instruction recording was not enabled during this transaction
            *   `preTokenBalances: <array|undefined>` - List of [token balances](/develop/rpcapi/json-structures#token-balances) from before the transaction was processed or omitted if token balance recording was not yet enabled during this transaction
            *   `postTokenBalances: <array|undefined>` - List of [token balances](/develop/rpcapi/json-structures#token-balances) from after the transaction was processed or omitted if token balance recording was not yet enabled during this transaction
            *   `logMessages: <array|null>` - array of string log messages or `null` if log message recording was not enabled during this transaction
            *   `rewards: <array|null>` - transaction-level rewards, populated if rewards are requested; an array of JSON objects containing:

            *   DEPRECATED: `status: <object>` - Transaction status
                *   `"Ok": <null>` - Transaction was successful
                *   `"Err": <ERR>` - Transaction failed with TransactionError
            *   `loadedAddresses: <object|undefined>` - Transaction addresses loaded from address lookup tables. Undefined if `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` is not set in request params, or if `jsonParsed` encoding is set in request params.
                *   `writable: <array[string]>` - Ordered list of base-58 encoded addresses for writable loaded accounts
