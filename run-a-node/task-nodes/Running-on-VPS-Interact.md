## How to interact now with the running Node?

1. Install dependencies (NodeJS + NPM)

```sh
sudo apt install npm
```

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo npm install -g npm@latest
```

Execute the command 'create-task-cli' and you will see an interactive menu

```sh
npx @_koii/create-task-cli@latest
```

```sh
? Select operation › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    Create a new local repository
    Deploy a new task
    update existing task
    Activate/Deactivate task
❯   Claim reward
    Fund task with more KOII
    Withdraw staked funds from task
    upload assets to IPFS(metadata/local vars)
```

## Example of how to claim rewards from the "Free Token Task!"

```sh
Calling ClaimReward
✔ Enter the task id … 4ipWnABntsvJPsAkwyMF7Re4z39ZUMs2S2dfEm5aa2is
✔ Enter the stakePotAccount address … stakepotaccountsP9iQfvCxMeS7RNNgrSVTDyxJRPQ
✔ Enter the beneficiaryAccount address (Address that the funds will be transferred to) … HERE_YOUR_WALLET_PUBLIC_ADDRESS
✔ Enter the path to Claimer wallet … /home/koii/koii-node/namespace/staking_wallet.json
Success
```

- `4ipWnABntsvJPsAkwyMF7Re4z39ZUMs2S2dfEm5aa2is` represents the Task ID
- `stakepotaccountsP9iQfvCxMeS7RNNgrSVTDyxJRPQ` represents the Stake Pot Account
- `HERE_YOUR_WALLET_PUBLIC_ADDRESS` represents the Wallet that will receive the claimed Coins
- `/home/koii/koii-node/namespace/staking_wallet.json` represents the default path to your staking wallet

## Example of how to Unstake from the "Free Token Task!"

```sh
1. Calling Withdraw staked funds from task
✔ Enter the task id … 4ipWnABntsvJPsAkwyMF7Re4z39ZUMs2S2dfEm5aa2is
✔ Enter the submitter wallet path address … /home/koii/koii-node/namespace/staking_wallet.json

Gives an error but don't worry, follow on with the next step ->

2. Calling ClaimReward
✔ Enter the task id … 4ipWnABntsvJPsAkwyMF7Re4z39ZUMs2S2dfEm5aa2is
✔ Enter the stakePotAccount address … stakepotaccountUSDX2sDSAcq8ZEvA3Tiv7tRpJ1Dv
✔ Enter the beneficiaryAccount address (Address that the funds will be transferred to) … HERE_YOUR_WALLET_PUBLIC_ADDRESS
✔ Enter the path to Claimer wallet … /home/koii/koii-node/namespace/staking_wallet.json
Success
```

- `4ipWnABntsvJPsAkwyMF7Re4z39ZUMs2S2dfEm5aa2is` represents the Task ID
- `stakepotaccountsP9iQfvCxMeS7RNNgrSVTDyxJRPQ` represents the Stake Pot Account
- `HERE_YOUR_WALLET_PUBLIC_ADDRESS` represents the Wallet that will receive the claimed Coins
- `/home/koii/koii-node/namespace/staking_wallet.json` represents the default path to your staking wallet

## Additional way to claim rewards using Koii_claimer

In order to have a semi-automatic way to claim $KOII rewards, you first need to get prerequisites which have to be stored in your server for Koii CLaimer to function.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eviangel/Koii_claimer
```

Then we enter that exact directory where the installation files can be found.

```sh
cd Koii_claimer
```

Then we need to create a .json file that contains the task configurations in order to claim rewards correctly

```sh
nano params.json
```

This will create a .json file now you need to fill in some information for example:

```json
{
    "taskStateInfoAddress": "4ipWnABntsvJPsAkwyMF7Re4z39ZUMs2S2dfEm5aa2is",
    "stakePotAccount": "stakepotaccountsP9iQfvCxMeS7RNNgrSVTDyxJRPQ",
    "beneficiaryAccount": "HERE_YOUR_WALLET_PUBLIC_ADDRESS",
    "claimerKeypairPath": "VPS-task/namespace/staking_wallet.json"
}
```

Please change the beneficiaryAccount here to make it your wallet public address.

Then all you need is to call :

```sh
npx koii_claimrewards@latest params.json
```

## Additional helpful commands you should know

```sh
koii -u https://mainnet.koii.network balance
koii --version
koii address
koii-keygen pubkey staking_wallet.json /or/ id.json
```

If you encounter after server restart that your "koii" commands are not working, you should set PATH again in order to fully function KOII CLI!

```sh
export PATH="/root/.local/share/koii/install/active_release/bin:$PATH" --check to verify what is your correct path in the certain server!
```

Feel free to reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/koii-network) if you have any further questions or need assistance.

The thing to note: You should always have to keep your Staking_Public_Key balance filled.
