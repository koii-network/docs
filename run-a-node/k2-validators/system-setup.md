:::warning
All of the following steps must be run on the **validator server**, unless otherwise specified.
:::

## 1. Ensure your system is up-to-date

Ensure your Ubuntu system is up-to-date and has all the base packages required

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang
```

## 2. Set up a user account

```sh
sudo adduser koii
sudo usermod -aG sudo koii
sudo su koii
cd ~
```

:::info
Please ensure that all the following steps are performed within the home directory of the `koii` user **(/home/koii)**
:::

## 3. Koii CLI setup

- Required both on your secure computer (for keypair generation) and on the validator

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koii-network/k2-release/master/k2-install-init_v1.16.6.sh)"
# You may need to update PATH variable for the cli to be available
echo 'export PATH="/home/koii/.local/share/koii/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
# Set the koii config to point to the mainnet
koii config set --url https://mainnet.koii.network
```

## 4. Key pair creation

:::info
Run commands for **only this step** on a **secure computer separate from the validator server, with the Koii CLI installed**
:::

We will be creating the following 4 key pairs:

```sh
koii-keygen new --outfile ~/validator-keypair.json
koii-keygen new --outfile ~/vote-account-keypair.json
koii-keygen new --outfile ~/stake-account-keypair.json
koii-keygen new --outfile ~/authorized-withdrawer-keypair.json
# To print your Public key(i.e. Wallet address) for any keypairs
# koii-keygen pubkey <Path to Keypair>
```

### Keypairs

- **validator-keypair.json :** Identity of the validator on the network. Copy this to the remote validator server at `/home/koii/validator-keypair.json`

- **vote-account-keypair.json** : Voting account on the network. Copy this to the remote validator server at `/home/koii/vote-account-keypair.json`

- **stake-account-keypair.json** : Keypair for your staking wallet. Store in a secure location **not on the validator** since this will hold the wallet that you delegate stake from

- **authorized-withdrawer-keypair.json** : Authorized withdrawer keypair, allowed to withdraw funds from your validator vote account. Store in a secure location **not on the validator** since this controls your vote account

:::danger
The **authorized withdrawer keypair** and the **stake account keypair** can be used to withdraw funds from your validator vote account.

The authorized withdrawer keypair also has additional permission to change all other aspects of your vote account. _Anyone in possession of it can permanently take control of your vote account and make any changes as they please._

**stake-account-keypair.json** and **authorized-withdrawer-keypair.json** must be stored in a secure location **NOT** on the validator.
:::

## 5. Network configuration

If you have firewall software installed you will need to allow traffic on the following ports:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 10000:10500/udp
sudo ufw allow 10000:10500/tcp
sudo ufw allow 10899/tcp
sudo ufw allow 10900/tcp
```

## 6. System tuning setup

- Create a file at `/etc/systemd/system/systuner.service` :

```sh
[Unit]
Description=Koii System Tuner
After=network.target
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=1
ExecStart=/home/koii/.local/share/koii/install/active_release/bin/koii-sys-tuner --user koii
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Start and Enable the service to automatically start

```sh
sudo systemctl start systuner
sudo systemctl enable systuner
```
