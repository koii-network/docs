# System Setup

> **All following steps need to be run on the validator server, unless mentioned otherwise.**
> 

## 1. Ensure system is up-to-date

Ensure your Ubuntu system is up-to-date and has all the base packages required

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang
```

## 2. User setup

```bash
sudo adduser koii
sudo usermod -aG sudo koii
sudo su koii
cd ~
```

<aside>
⚠️ Please ensure that all the **following steps** happen within the home directory (/home/koii) of the `koii` user

</aside>

## 3. Koii cli setup

* Required both on your secure computer for keypair generation and on the validator

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koii-network/k2-release/master/k2-install-init_v1.16.1.sh)"
# You may need to update PATH variable for the cli to be available
echo 'export PATH="/home/koii/.local/share/koii/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
# Set the koii config to point to the testnet
koii config set --url https://testnet.koii.network

```

## 4. Key pairs creation

> Run commands for **only this step** on a **secure computer** **separate from the validator server**
You need to **install Koii cli on this secure computer** as well, to be able to use the  commands below
> 

We will be creating the following 4 key pairs:

```bash
koii-keygen new --outfile ~/validator-keypair.json
koii-keygen new --outfile ~/vote-account-keypair.json
koii-keygen new --outfile ~/stake-account-keypair.json
koii-keygen new --outfile ~/authorized-withdrawer-keypair.json
# To print your Public key(i.e. Wallet address) for any keypairs
# koii-keygen pubkey <Path to Keypair>
```

- **validator-keypair.json :** Identity of the validator on the network
    - Copy this to the remote validator server at `/home/koii/validator-keypair.json`
- **vote-account-keypair.json** : Voting account on the network
    - Copy this to the remote validator server at `/home/koii/vote-account-keypair.json`
- **stake-account-keypair.json** : Keypair for your staking wallet
    - Keep this secure since this will hold the wallet that you delegate stake from
- **authorized-withdrawer-keypair.json** : Authorized withdrawer keypair, allowed to withdraw funds from your validator vote account ****

:::danger
The **authorized withdrawer keypair** is the ultimate authority over your validator. This keypair will be able to withdraw from your vote account and will have additional permission to change all other aspects of your vote account.
*Anyone in possession of it can permanently take control of your vote account and make any changes as they please.*
:::


:::tip
**`stake-account-keypair.json`**  and **`authorized-withdrawer-keypair.json`** must be stored in a secure location **NOT on the validator.**
:::


## 5. Network configuration

If you have firewall software installed you will need to allow traffic on the following ports:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 10000:10500/udp
sudo ufw allow 10000:10500/tcp
sudo ufw allow 10899/tcp
sudo ufw allow 10900/tcp
```

## 6. Systuning setup

- Create a file at `/etc/systemd/system/systuner.service` :
    
    ```bash
    [Unit]
    Description=Koii System Tuner 
    After=network.target 
    [Service]
    Type=simple 
    Restart=on-failure 
    RestartSec=1 
    ExecStart=/home/koii/.local/share/koii/install/active_release/bin/koii-sys-tuner --user koii
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    
    ```
    
- Start and Enable the service to automatically start
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

    sudo systemctl enable systuner
    sudo systemctl start systuner
    ```

- Check logs

    ```bash
    sudo journalctl -u systuner.service -f
    ```
