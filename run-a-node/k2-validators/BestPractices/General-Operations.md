# Koii Validator Operations Best Practices  

After successfully setting up and starting a validator on the Koii network, it's essential to familiarize yourself with daily operations to ensure your validator runs efficiently. Day-to-day tasks include monitoring your server, updating software (both the Koii validator software and operating system packages), and managing your validator identity and associated accounts.  

Consistently practicing these skills is vital. Maximizing your validator's uptime is crucial for being a reliable operator and contributing to the health of the network.

## Educational Resources  
The Koii validator community regularly shares educational content to help operators improve their skills. Stay tuned to the official Koii community [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/koii-network) for updates on workshops, webinars, and guides tailored for validator operators.

## Using the Validator Command Line  
For a comprehensive understanding of available commands and their flags, use the `koii-validator` command with the `--help` flag:  

```bash  
koii-validator --help  
```

---

## Restarting Your Validator  
Occasionally, you may need to restart your validator for maintenance or updates. As a best practice, avoid restarting during a leader slot, as this is when your validator is responsible for producing blocks. Restarting during this time can impact the network's health and your validator's ability to earn rewards.  

To determine when your validator is scheduled to produce blocks, you can view the leader schedule for the current epoch:  

```bash  
koii leader-schedule  
```  

Once you identify a suitable idle time, use the following command to exit your validator process cleanly:  

```bash  
koii-validator exit  
```

If you have set up `systemd` for managing your validator process, the process should restart automatically.

## Upgrading Your Validator  
Keeping your validator software up-to-date is critical. Validators do not need to go offline to download the latest version of the Koii software. You can either build the software from source or use precompiled binaries.  

### Building from Source  
Building from source ensures the integrity of the code and allows optimization for your specific hardware. Use the `-march` flag during compilation to target your CPU architecture.  

### Using `koii-install`  
For a quicker method, use the `koii-install` tool to fetch and install specific versions of the Koii validator software. For example:  

```bash  
koii-install init 1.14.17  
```

Once installed, restart the validator process to apply the new version:  

```bash  
koii-validator exit  
``` 

Verify the version in use by checking the logs:  

```bash  
grep -B1 'Starting validator with' <path/to/logfile>  
```

---

## Snapshots and Ledger Maintenance  
To maintain the health of the network, it is generally advised to avoid downloading snapshots unless absolutely necessary, such as during prolonged downtime or the initial setup of a validator. Instead, maintain the local ledger and catch up using:  

```bash  
koii catchup <validator-public-key>  
``` 

If you must download a snapshot, omit the `--no-snapshot-fetch` flag, and your validator will fetch one from known validators. To manually download a snapshot, use the `koii gossip` command to identify a validator and retrieve the necessary files.  

---

## Monitoring Account Balances  
Your validator identity account requires sufficient funds to continue voting. Regularly check the balance to ensure uninterrupted operations:  

```bash  
koii balance validator-keypair.json  
```

---

## Withdrawing From the Vote Account  
For security reasons, the withdrawer's keypair should never be stored on your validator server. Instead, use a hardware wallet, paper wallet, or a multisig wallet.  

To withdraw funds, run the following command from a trusted environment:  

```bash  
koii withdraw-from-vote-account \
   vote-account-keypair.json \
   recipient-keypair.json ALL \
   --authorized-withdrawer authorized-withdrawer-keypair.json  
``` 

Refer to the Koii documentation for detailed guidance on vote account management.  

---

By adhering to these best practices, you can maintain a secure, efficient, and high-performing Koii validator, ensuring both the health of the network and your operational success.
