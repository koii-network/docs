## Q: I accidentally clicked on the testnet. how can I open again my Koii app/node?

**For Mac**: Delete this file and start the node ~/Library/Application Support/desktop-node/config.json

**For Linux**: Delete this file and start the node ~/.config/desktop-node/config.json

## Q: I changed computer, can I sync my old Koii node with my new Koii nodes?

**On VPS**: We don't have the support as of now for the seeds of staking_wallet (Will add in future).
**On PC**: What you should have done is **backup the private key of staking_wallet** which is found under `<path_to_k2_vps_repo>/namespace/staking_wallet.json` and as for the main wallet that is the one created using koii-keygen
(Also outputs the seed phrase for you to store) and can be found under koii config get command KeyPair Path.

## Q: What should I do if I lose track of the node and can't restart it?

If you're having trouble locating or restarting the node, it's
important to note that the node **may be minimized**. Please **check your system tray** or similar areas where minimized applications are displayed. You'll likely find the node there, and you can close it from that location. Once closed,
you should be able to restart the node without any issues. This step ensures that you regain control over the node's operation.

## Q: What should I do if my task Configurations doesn't auto-pair?

We strongly recommend using the default extension names, "TWITTER_USERNAME", and "KEYWORD" etc, noting that these are **case-sensitive**, for tasks. This practice ensures that task configurations are automatically paired when you start the task.

Should you need to change the names of these configurations, please proceed to **Settings**, select **Task Extensions**, and then click on the **pencil icon** to make your adjustments.
