to the **NEW** System Key.

After the **NEW** account is active please go to "Add Task"
Add in order:
Inflation Monitoring and wait for confirmation.
Free Fire Token and wait for confirmation.
After your tasks are running in My Node, go to Wallet.
Send 10 $Koii from your **NEW System Key** to the **NEW Staking Key**.
Make Sure that your new **KPL Staking key** has been set with about 0.079 $Koii.
Send 3 $Koii from your **New System Key** to your **New KPL Staking Key**
Add as many tasks as you want and migrate all the other tokens from the old account to the new 
one.
:::warning
To migrate your tokens don't forget to leave at least 2 $Koii on your **OLD SYSTEM KEY** 
to pay for the blockchain's fees of your tokens' transactions.
