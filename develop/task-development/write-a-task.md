:::tip Tutorial

We recommend **[EZSandbox](https://github.com/koii-network/ezsandbox)** as your first step if you've never written a task before. It will walk you through the basic concepts of a task, the most common functions you'll use, creating your own KPL token, and deploying a task with your new token.

## Task Template

Are you an experienced task developer? Grab the [task template](https://github.com/koii-network/task-template) and start hacking!

## Other Languages

Koii Tasks are written mostly in JavaScript, but once you understand the basics, you can use any language that compiles to WebAssembly, or deploy tasks using the [ORCA container manager](/develop/write-a-koii-task/orca/intro).
