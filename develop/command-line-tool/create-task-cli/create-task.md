# Getting Started:

- To deploy a new task, select the following option:

```sh
? Select operation › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    Create a new local repository
❯   Deploy a new task
    update existing task
    Activate/Deactivate task
    Claim reward
    Fund task with more KOII
    Withdraw staked funds from task
    upload assets to IPFS(metadata/local vars)
```

- There are two options to deploy a new task, the next prompt asks you to select how you want to deploy your task:

```sh
? Select operation › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   using CLI
    using config YML
```
## Using config YML [Recommended]

The `config-task.yml` is the configuration file that contains the information needed to create a task. You can find a sample `config-task.yml` in the root directory of your task folder.

The `config-task.yml` should look like this:

```yaml
# Task Name: (Required) 
task_name: 'task name'
# Task Author: (Required) 
author: 'Koii'
# Task Description: (Required) 
description: 'description'
# Repository URL: (Required)
repositoryUrl: 'https://github.com/koii-network/task-template' 
# Image URL: (Required) Will be displayed in desktop node
imageUrl: 'imageUrl'
# Info URL: (Required) Will be displayed in desktop node
infoUrl: 'infoUrl'

# Task executable network: (Required | DEVELOPMENT, ARWEAVE, or IPFS) : IPFS is the default and common value
task_executable_network: 'IPFS'

# Task audit program: (Required) IPFS: Path to your executable | DEVELOPMENT: Leave it as 'main'

# Minimum stake amount: (Required) The minimum amount of KOII that a user must stake in order to participate in the task.
minimum_stake_amount: 1.9

# Task Bounty Type: (Required | KOII or KPL) 
task_type: 'KPL'

# Token Mint Address: (ONLY task_type == KPL) Fire Token as an example here. 
token_type: "BAmB86Mt6FDaqTjLzKimBjHtwV93PGQitjW5zKNnBVEU"

# Total bounty amount:  (Required) The total bounty amount that will be distributed to the task. (Not accepted in case of update task).
total_bounty_amount: 10

# Bounty amount per round: (Required) Every round's maximum distribution, you can decide the logics in your task. 
bounty_amount_per_round: 0.1

# Allowed failed distributions: (Required) Number of times re-submission is allowed for the distribution list in case of an audit, it is also the rounds of submission it will keep. 
allowed_failed_distributions: 3

# Space: (Required) Expected Task Data Size in MBs for the account size. 
# Minimum: 1 for production, 0.1 for testing; Calculation Details: https://www.koii.network/docs/develop/command-line-tool/create-task-cli/create-task#space

# Requirement Tags: (Optional): To add more global variables and task variables, please refer to the type, value, description format shown below.
requirementsTags:
  - type: CPU
    value: '4-core'
  - type: RAM
    value: '5 GB'
  - type: STORAGE
    value: '5 GB'
  - type: TASK_VARIABLE
    value: 'TWITTER_PASSWORD'
    description: 'The password of your volunteer Twitter account.'

# Tags: You can select the tags here via https://www.koii.network/docs/develop/command-line-tool/create-task-cli/create-task#tags
tags: ["AI", "ML"] 
# Environment: (Required | TEST or PRODUCTION) Production mode will expose your task to all the task runners. 
environment: "TEST"

#################################### BELOW IS FOR UPDATE TASK ONLY ####################################
# Old Task ID: (ONLY for task update) 
task_id: ''

# Migration Description: (ONLY for task update)
migrationDescription: ''

```
### Requirement Tags
Please make sure all of your environment variables are included in the `requirementsTags` section.
If you want to use Twitter username in your JavaScript file, 
```js
const username = process.env.TWITTER_USER_NAME;
```

you need to include

```yaml
- type: TASK_VARIABLE
  value: "TWITTER_USER_NAME"
  description: "used to connect twitter"
```
in your config-task.yaml. 

The `value` name should be the same as your environment variable name. The vital thing to remember is that the value is the actual JavaScript valid property identifier, so it needs to follow the naming <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_objects#accessing_properties" target="_blank"> rules</a>.

You can add multiple task variables in the following format. 
```yaml
requirementsTags:
  - type: TASK_VARIABLE
    value: "TWITTER_USER_NAME"
    description: "used to connect twitter"
```

### Tags 
We currently offer the following tags: 
- Data Gathering
- Hosting
- Storage
- Bandwidth
- Social Posting
- Witness
- Web Crawling
- Database
- AI
- DeFi

### Space
To understand how much storage you need to use, let's think about how much data we need to store in each task state. 
Each task would require around 5KB storage for the task state. 
Each round supposing there are 1 user submit a task CID, the storage would cost 32 bytes public key size and 32 bytes of the CID size, which is 64 bytes in total... As the user receive the rewards, each user will cost 32 bytes of their public key size in the task state, plus their rewards number...
Each user who run your task would increase 32 bytes of their public key and plus their stake amount...

Examples of spaces: 
- A normal whitelisted task would take 2-3 MB of storage. 

Therefore, we have set the following standard. 
For your own testing, 0.1 MB would be a safe value to input as space. 
For our displayed tasks, we need to keep it at least 1 MB. 
For our whitelisted tasks, we need to keep it at least 2 MB. 

- After updating the config file, run:

```sh
npx @_koii/create-task-cli@latest
```

again and choose "using config YML".

- If an error occurs, follow the provided instructions for correction. If successful, your terminal will display an output similar to this:

```sh
Your MetaData CID is bafybeibjbtiendwzxq3ou5hsgauyym4wcg4gtodbhssh4cxhxdipqibrrm/metadata.json

Your account will be deducted 16.96090088 KOII for creating the task, which includes the rent exemption(6.96090088 KOII) and bounty amount fees (10 KOII) ›
```

- Confirm by entering `y` to deduct the necessary KOII amount for task creation.
- You will receive details of your task, including the "Task Id" and "Stake Pot Account Pubkey."

## Using the CLI

When opting for this method to deploy a new task, you will be prompted to enter all the essential information needed for task deployment.

Follow these instructions to input the required details:

- **Enter the name of the task:** Provide a name for your task. Your choice is entirely flexible (e.g., `Blazing-Fast-Execution`).

- **Enter a short description of your task:** Enter a concise description of your task's purpose.
  :::caution
  The description should not exceed 64 characters.
  :::

- **Please select the type of network: ** Choose **IPFS** for storage of your executable file, or **DEVELOPMENT** if you want to test in development environment.
  :::note
  The next prompt depends on your answer to the prompt above.
  :::

- [For DEVELOPMENT] **Enter the name of executable you want to run on task-nodes:** Enter a desired name for your task executable, this will be the same name of the executable file that will exist in the task node's executables folder.
  :::caution
  The name should not contain `.js`. For example, if you want to run `task-mytask.js`, you should enter `task-mytask` as the executable name.
  :::

- [For IPFS] **Enter the path to your executable webpack:** Provide the absolute path to your executable file. E.g: `/Users/<YOUR_HOME>/Documents/testing-task/dist/main.js`

- **Enter the round time in slots:** Define the preferred number of slots per round for your task (e.g., `3000`).

- **Enter the audit window in slots:** Specify the number of slots to be allocated to the audit window (e.g., `1200`).

- **Enter the submission window in slots:** Specify the number of slots to be allocated to the submission window (e.g., `1200`).
  :::caution
  Ensure that the audit and submission window slot numbers are lower than the slots per round.
  :::

- **Enter the minimum staking amount for the task (in KOII):** Set the minimum amount that node operators must stake on your task (e.g., `1.9`).

- **Enter the total bounty you want to allocate for the task (In KOII):** Define the total bounty allocated for your task (e.g., `1000`). It should be an amount that can cover at least 4 epochs.

- **Enter the bounty amount per round (In KOII):** Total amount would be divided equally for each node until the bounty fund is exhausted (e.g., `10`).

- **Enter the number of distribution list submission retry in case it fails:** Specify the number of accepted attempts to resubmit the distribution list if the initial submission fails.

- **Enter TaskMetadata CID hosted on IPFS (Leave empty for None):** If you've hosted the task's metadata on IPFS, enter the CID here; otherwise, leave this field empty.

- **Enter the space, you want to allocate for task account (in MBs):** Each task would need some storage for persistence, in general in MBs (e.g., `10`).
- **Your account will be deducted 16.96090088 KOII for creating the task, which includes the rent exemption(6.96090088 KOII) and bounty amount fees (10 KOII) › ** y/n

- **Final Confirmation:** Upon final confirmation (typically by entering `y`), your task will be created, and a `taskStateInfoKeypair.json` file will be generated to manage task state information.

:::danger
Strong measures should be taken to protect this JSON file.
:::

The output of the command should be similar to the following.
